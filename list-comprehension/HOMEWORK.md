# Functional List Comprehension in JavaScript

*Doing More with Less*

## Introduction

This presentation and pre-course work will introduce you to the basics of _list comprehension_, a set of tools and patterns for filtering, transforming, and manipulating _collections_ (objects and arrays).

As a career programmer, prepare yourself to spend... a lot – a lot! – of time slinging objects and arrays around. Learning to manipulate collections will boost your productivity in ways few other habits can. As development fads come and go in the software world, one thing never changes: the need to move data around. That's where this presentation comes in.

To prepare for the presentation on December 9, you'll be opening your very own [_bidness_](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Bidness): an online dating service. Don't worry, a customer list is already provided! Follow the exercises below, taking each one in order.

First, the rules:

### Plain Ole JavaScript Only – No Libraries!

JavaScript's ES5 (ECMAScript 5.x) specification, also known as "plain ole JavaScript", does not natively support "list comprehension". In other words, to effectively manipulate lists of data, you have to augment the langauge with a library (or upgrade to ES6) to access the most powerful tools. Fortunately, those libraries exist; they're lightweight (small footprint in KBs), loosely coupled (are used in a wide variety of settings), and most of all, powerful (can solve lots of problems).

That's nice an' all... But, before reviewing these tools and their use – *which we will do in class* – it's helpful to _first gain an appreciation of real-world problems related to manipulating lists_. So, just to start, we'll be playing left-handed.

### Don't Get Stuck

The exercises below should be fun. Do your best and be creative, but don't stay up all night counting dating candidates – we'll talk about each problem in details in class, demonstrating short, concise solutions.

### REPL

For these problems, you might consider finding a JavaScript [REPL](https://nodejs.org/api/repl.html) to practice. Remember, don't get lost in setting up tools – you'll waste time – focus on the problems and potential solutions. A simple REPL for JavaScript is your Google Developer Tools (the Console) in Chrome (Cmd-Opt-I on a Mac). You can also just create a an HTML file, link your JavaScript to it, and print your answers to console, via `console.log`. Or not, whatever...
